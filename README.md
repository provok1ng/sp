SwiftPaxos: Fast Geo-Replicated State Machines
==========
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/provok1ng/sp)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/provok1ng/sp)

This repository contains the prototype implementation of SwiftPaxos, a new state-machine replication protocol for geo-distributed systems.
SwiftPaxos is a _faster Paxos without compromises_.
In the best case, it executes a state-machine command in two message delays (one round-trip), and three otherwise.
SwiftPaxos was [presented](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/presentation/ryabinin) at the 21st USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation ([NSDI '24](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24)).

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/provok1ng/sp.git
    cd swiftpaxos
    go install github.com/provok1ng/sp

| Paxos                   | The classic Paxos protocol.                       |
| N<sup>2</sup>Paxos      | All-to-all variant of Paxos.                      |
| CURP                    | CURP implemented over N<sup>2</sup>Paxos.         |
| Fast Paxos              | Fast Paxos with uncoordinated collision recovery. |
| EPaxos                  | A [corrected][epaxos_correct] version of EPaxos.  |

This software is based on the [Egalitarian Paxos](https://github.com/otrack/epaxos) code base, as well as the corrections made [here](https://github.com/otrack/epaxos).

Usage
-----
#### participants
There are three types of participants: *master*, *servers* and *clients*. 
The servers and clients implement the protocol logic. 
The master maintains the configuration of the system.

#### deployment configuration
To setup a run, the participants read deployment configuration file. 
See [aws.conf][config] for an example of configuration file for AWS EC2.

#### launching a participant

Master:
    
    swiftpaxos -run master -config conf.conf

Server:

    swiftpaxos -run server -config conf.conf -alias server_name

Client:

    swiftpaxos -run client -config conf.conf -alias client_name

#### command line options

    -alias alias
        An alias of this participant
    -config file
        Deployment config file (required)
    -latency file
        Latency config file
    -log file
        Path to the log file
    -protocol protocol
        Protocol to run. Overwrites protocol field of the config file
    -quorum file
        Quorum config file
    -run participant
        Run a participant

See [quorum.conf][quorum] and [latency.conf][latency] for an example of quorum and latency configuration files.

Flint
-----

To have an idea on how different replication protocols would compare, we wrote a tool named [Flint][flint]. 
Flint takes as input a set of AWS regions.
It computes the expected latencies and estimates how the protocols perform in such a deployment.
